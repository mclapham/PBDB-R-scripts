PBDB R scripts
==============

This repository houses R scripts that I have written for various papers or projects. They pull data directly from the Paleobiology Database based on user-specific parameters using the PaleobioDB API. Each script has detailed instructions in the introductory comments and can just be pasted into R and used.
