PBDB R scripts
==============

This repository houses R scripts that I have written for various papers or projects. They pull data directly from the Paleobiology Database using user-directed parameters using the PaleobioDB API. Each script has detailed instructions in the introductory comments and can just be pasted into R and used. Send comments or suggestions to mclapham@ucsc.edu.
